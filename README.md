# Fourier Series Approximation

This Python project demonstrates the Fourier series approximation of a given function. It uses various libraries to perform calculations and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- **Fourier.py**: Contains the core logic for computing the Fourier series approximation and saves the graph as `output.jpeg`.
- **window.py**: display output.jpeg in a window

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
- `PIL` (Pillow): For image processing.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `scipy.integrate`: For numerical integration.

## Installation


1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy tkinter pillow matplotlib scipy
    ```

## Usage

1. Enter the function you want to approximate in function `f(x)` in `Fourier.py`
2. Run the `Fourier.py` file to start the application:
    ```bash
    python Fourier.py
    ```

3. The application will display the original function and its Fourier series approximation.

## Example

Here's an example of how the Fourier series approximation looks for a function:
