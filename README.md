# Fourier Series Approximation

This Python project demonstrates the Fourier series approximation of a given function. It uses various libraries to perform calculations and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- **Fourier.py**: Contains the core logic for computing the Fourier series approximation and managing the graphical user interface using Tkinter.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
- `PIL` (Pillow): For image processing.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `scipy.integrate`: For numerical integration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy tkinter pillow matplotlib scipy
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `Fourier.py` file to start the application:
    ```bash
    python Fourier.py
    ```

2. Enter the function you want to approximate and the number of terms for the Fourier series.

3. The application will display the original function and its Fourier series approximation.

## Example

Here's an example of how the Fourier series approximation looks for a square wave function:
